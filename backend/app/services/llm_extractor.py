- Include both primary and secondary role options
- Consider experience level from resume content
- If the skills do not align with any of the main domains above, you MUST pick from the Fallback/General Tech Domains above, and suggest the most relevant domain(s) and roles where jobs exist for those skills, even if the match is weak or partial. Do NOT return an empty list. Always return at least one domain and 2+ roles that exist in the job market.

**Example:**
If the candidate's skills are ['Excel', 'Customer Service', 'Documentation'], you might return:
"identified_domains": [
  {{"domain": "General Tech & IT", "matching_skills": ["Excel", "Documentation"], "confidence": "low"}}
],
"suggested_roles": [

1. **Keyword Match (20% weight)**: Identify how well the resume incorporates keywords and phrases found in the job description, including tools, technologies, soft skills, and responsibilities.

2. **Skills Relevance (20% weight)**: Evaluate how the listed skills align with the required skills in the JD.

3. **Job Title Match (15% weight)**: Determine how closely the candidate's previous job titles match the desired role.

4. **Relevant Experience (15% weight)**: Assess whether the work experience demonstrates expertise in relevant areas, including total years of experience and recency.

5. **Education Fit (10% weight)**: Determine whether the degree(s), field of study, and institution level meet or exceed the minimum educational qualifications.

6. **Certifications (5% weight)**: Check if relevant industry certifications are present, particularly those mentioned in the JD.

7. **Section Completeness (5% weight)**: Ensure essential sections are present ‚Äî Contact Info, Summary, Work Experience, Skills, Education, Projects, and Certifications.

8. **Resume Formatting (5% weight)**: Evaluate whether the resume is ATS-friendly ‚Äî no tables, no multi-column layouts, minimal graphics, no header/footer content misuse.

9. **Grammar & Clarity (3% weight)**: Identify any spelling or grammatical issues and check for clarity and professionalism in language.

- **20-39%**: Poor Fit - Limited alignment, major improvements needed
- **0-19%**: Not a Fit - Very little to no alignment

**CALCULATE SCORES DYNAMICALLY:**
- Count actual keyword matches vs total job keywords
- Assess skill overlap percentage
- Evaluate experience level alignment
- Consider industry/domain relevance
- Factor in role title similarity
- Weight each criterion appropriately

**IMPORTANT SCORING RULES**: 
- **NEVER use example scores (like 78, 85, etc.) - calculate actual scores based on analysis**
- **Count exact keyword matches** - if job mentions "Python" and resume has "Python", count it
- **Be honest about gaps** - if major skills are missing, score should be lower
- **Vary scores significantly** - different resumes should get very different scores
- **Focus on role relevance** - wrong role type should get low scores
- **Consider experience mismatch** - junior vs senior misalignment affects score
- **Weight criteria appropriately** - keyword match and skills relevance are most important
